    <p><strong>Difficulty: Easy</strong></p>
    <p><strong>#tiramisu #italian #dessert</strong></p>
    <p>Tiramisu is one of the cornerstones of Italian cuisine, one of the best-loved and most frequently made desserts in the entire world.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Mascarpone cheese, 750g</li>
        <li>Eggs, 5</li>
        <li>Ladyfingers, 250g</li>
        <li>Sugar, 120g</li>
        <li>Coffee, 300g</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate the eggs, being careful to keep the whites totally free of yolk. Beat the yolks with a hand mixer, adding half of the sugar, add the mascarpone a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Set the cream aside.  Clean the mixer well and move on to whipping the egg whites. Once they're foamy, pour in the remaining sugar a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Take a spoonful of the whites and add it to the bowl with the mascarpone cream, then stir vigorously with a spatula to dilute the mixture. Next, add the rest of the egg whites little by little, folding them in by mixing very gently from the bottom upwards.</li>
        <li>Spread a heaping spoonful on the bottom of a glass baking dish. Dip the ladyfingers into the cold coffee for under a second. Then arrange the coffee-soaked ladyfingers in the dish.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of mascarpone cream and level it so the cookies are covered completely. Continue in layers.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle over sliced chocolate, and leave the tiramisu to set in the fridge for a couple of hours. Your tiramisu is ready to be enjoyed!</li>
